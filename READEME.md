Introduction

This is a simple Tic Tac Toe game built using Python's tkinter library, which provides a graphical user interface (GUI). The game allows two players (Player X and Player O) to take turns, marking the tiles on a 3x3 grid. The objective is to line up three of their symbols (X or O) in a row, column, or diagonal.
